OTOduino is a visualized sound modem iPhone application for Arduino(TM). With this application, Arduino IO ports can be controlled by iPhone via ear phone.
This source codes are released under The MIT license.

Making an original iPhone external device was difficult because standard SDK does not provide a framework to access an iPhone dock connector. This application that sends and receives modulated audible signal to communicate with Arduino via ear phone is a good example to start your original iPhone device and its application developments.

This application has been developed by a freelance engineer Akihiro UEHARA. I have been providing iPhone application development services. If you have questions or troubles in application developments, please contact to me.
